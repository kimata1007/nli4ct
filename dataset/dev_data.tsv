For subjects without recurrence, progression or death, it is censored at the last valid tumor assessment. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions. Here, the time to event was reported as the restricted mean survival time. The restricted mean survival time was defined as the area under the curve of the survival function up to 24 months.  Time frame: From randomization date to recurrence, progression or death, assessed up to 38 months. The result is based on primary analysis data cut.Results 1:   Arm/Group Title: Neratinib Plus Capecitabine  Arm/Group Description: neratinib 240 mg orally, once daily with food, continuously in 21 day cycles, and capecitabine 1500 mg/m^2 daily in 2 evenly divided doses, orally with water within 30 minutes after a meal, taken on days 1 to 14 of each 21 day cycle.

The RDS scale is a revised form of the NIH Common Toxicity Criteria to account for color and subtle texture changes in the skin. The worst dermatitis (i.e., highest RDS score) at the end of treatment was used for the primary analysis of severity of radiation dermatitis in each treatment group. Additionally, we performed repeated measure analyses to examine the severity of dermatitis over time in each arm.

The time interval from the date of randomization until the first date on which recurrence, progression (per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST) v1.1), or death due to any cause, is documented. For subjects without recurrence, progression or death, it is censored at the last valid tumor assessment. Progression is defined using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.1), as a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions. Here, the time to event was reported as the restricted mean survival time. The restricted mean survival time was defined as the area under the curve of the survival function up to 24 months.  Time frame: From randomization date to recurrence, progression or death, assessed up to 38 months. The result is based on primary analysis data cut.Results 1:   Arm/Group Title: Neratinib Plus Capecitabine  Arm/Group Description: neratinib 240 mg orally, once daily with food, continuously in 21 day cycles, and capecitabine 1500 mg/m^2 daily in 2 evenly divided doses, orally with water within 30 minutes after a meal, taken on days 1 to 14 of each 21 day cycle.

In the event of the appearance of a <6 mm lesions(s) without CNS lesions, or equivocal findings potentially suggesting leptomeningeal disease, these findings were followed with a subsequent scan within 6 weeks.

Contradiction	Outcome Measurement:   Number of Participants With Central Nervous System (CNS) Metastases (as Assessed by Independent Review) as the Site of First Relapse  CNS relapse is defined as the appearance of >=1 enhancing lesion measuring >=6 millimeters (mm) on T1Weighted (T1W) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) without CNS symptoms that were considered to be unequivocal based on all relevant radiological features (e.g., associated T2W signal abnormality); the appearance of any enhancing lesion on T1W MRI with CNS symptoms; unequivocal finding of leptomeningeal disease (defined as the dissemination of cancer throughout the spinal fluid), with or without symptoms; and unequivocal finding of multifocal intraparenchymal lesions with or without symptoms. In the event of the appearance of a <6 mm lesions(s) without CNS lesions, or equivocal findings potentially suggesting leptomeningeal disease, these findings were followed with a subsequent scan within 6 weeks. If unequivocal progression was determined with the subsequent scan and/or CNS symptoms occurred, then CNS relapse crieria were met.  Time frame: From randomization until disease progression, death, or discontinuation from the study (average of 10 months). Cut-off 11-Jun-2012Results 1:   Arm/Group Title: Lapatinib Plus Capecitabine  Arm/Group Description: Participants received a daily dose of 5 tablets of lapatinib (1250 mg) at approximately the same time every day, either 1 hour (or more) before breakfast or 1 hour (or more) after breakfast. Participants also received capecitabine 2000 mg/m^2) per day (divided and administered orally twice daily, 12 hours apart), for 14 days, every 21 days. Capecitabine was taken with food or within 30 minutes after food. Participants received study medication until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or participant withdrawal.

Entailment	Outcome Measurement:   Number of Patients With Pathological Complete Response Rate  Pathologic complete response (pCR), commonly defined as the absence of residual invasive cancer in both the breast and axillary lymph nodes, has emerged as a surrogate endpoint for disease-free and overall survival, as the achievement of a pCR is associated with a favorable long-term prognosis in all breast cancer subtypes.
