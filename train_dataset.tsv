The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status must be 0 or 1.  Patients must have the ability to swallow oral medication.  The diagnosis of invasive adenocarcinoma of the breast must have been made by core needle biopsy or by limited incisional biopsy.  Patients must have ER analysis performed on the primary tumor prior to randomization. If ER analysis is negative, then progesterone receptor (PgR) analysis must also be performed. (Patients are eligible with either hormone receptor-positive or hormone receptor-negative tumors.)  Breast cancer must be determined to be HER2-positive prior to randomization. Assays using FISH or CISH require gene amplification. Assays using IHC require a strongly positive (3+) staining score.  Clinical staging, based on the assessment by physical exam, must be American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage IIB, IIIA, IIIB, or IIIC: cT2 and cN1; cT3 and cN0 or cN1; Any cT and cN2 or cN3; or cT4  The patient must have a mass in the breast or axilla measuring greater than or equal to 2.0 cm by physical exam, unless the patient has inflammatory breast cancer, in which case measurable disease by physical exam is not required.  At the time of randomization, blood counts performed within 4 weeks prior to randomization must meet the following criteria: absolute neutrophil count (ANC) must be greater than or equal to 1200/mm3; Platelet count must be greater than or equal to 100,000/mm3; Hemoglobin must be greater than or equal to 10 g/dL  The following criteria for evidence of adequate hepatic function performed within 4 weeks prior to randomization must be met: total bilirubin must be less than or equal to upper limit of normal (ULN) for the lab unless the patient has a bilirubin elevation greater than ULN to 1.5 x ULN due to Gilbert's disease or similar syndrome involving slow conjugation of bilirubin; and alkaline phosphatase must be less than or equal to 2.5 x ULN for the lab; and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and ALT must be less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN for the lab.  Patients with alkaline phosphatase greater than ULN but less than or equal to 2.5 x ULN are eligible for inclusion in the study if liver imaging (CT, MRI, PET, or PET-CT scan) performed within 4 weeks prior to randomization does not demonstrate metastatic disease and the requirements for adequate hepatic function are met.  Patients with either unexplained skeletal pain or alkaline phosphatase that is greater than ULN but less than or equal to 2.5 x ULN are eligible for inclusion in the study if a bone scan, PET-CT scan, or PET scan performed within 4 weeks prior to randomization does not demonstrate metastatic disease. Patients with suspicious findings on bone scan or PET scan are eligible if suspicious findings are determined to be benign by x-ray, MRI, or biopsy.  Serum creatinine performed within 4 weeks prior to randomization must be less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN for the lab.  The left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) assessment by 2-D echocardiogram or multiple gated acquisition(MUGA) scan performed within 90 days prior to randomization must be greater than or equal to 50% regardless of the facility's LLN.Exclusion Criteria:  fine-needle aspiration (FNA) alone to diagnose the primary breast cancer.  Excisional biopsy or lumpectomy performed prior to randomization.  Surgical axillary staging procedure prior to randomization. (Procedures that are permitted prior to study entry include: 1) FNA or core biopsy of an axillary node for any patient, and 2) although not recommended, a pre-neoadjuvant therapy SN biopsy for patients with clinically negative axillary nodes.)  Definitive clinical or radiologic evidence of metastatic disease. (Note: Chest imaging [mandatory for all patients] and other imaging [if required] must have been performed within 90 days prior to randomization.)  History of ipsilateral invasive breast cancer regardless of treatment or ipsilateral ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) treated with radiation therapy (RT). (Patients with a history of LCIS are eligible.)  Contralateral invasive breast cancer at any time. (Patients with contralateral DCIS or lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) are eligible.)  History of non-breast malignancies (except for in situ cancers treated only by local excision and basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin) within 5 years prior to randomization.  Known metastatic disease from any malignancy (solid tumor or hematologic).  Previous therapy with anthracyclines, taxanes, cyclophosphamide, trastuzumab, or neratinib for any malignancy.  Treatment including RT, chemotherapy, and/or targeted therapy, administered for the currently diagnosed breast cancer prior to randomization.  Continued endocrine therapy such as raloxifene or tamoxifen (or other SERM) or an aromatase inhibitor. (Patients are eligible if these medications are discontinued prior to randomization.)  Any continued sex hormonal therapy, e.g., birth control pills and ovarian hormone replacement therapy. Patients are eligible if these medications are discontinued prior to randomization.  Active hepatitis B or hepatitis C with abnormal liver function tests.  Intrinsic lung disease resulting in dyspnea.  Active infection or chronic infection requiring chronic suppressive antibiotics.  Malabsorption syndrome, ulcerative colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, resection of the stomach or small bowel, or other disease or condition significantly affecting gastrointestinal function.  Persistent greater than or equal to grade 2 diarrhea regardless of etiology.  Sensory or motor neuropathy greater than or equal to grade 2, as defined by the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Effects (CTCAE) v3.0.  Conditions that would prohibit intermittent administration of corticosteroids for paclitaxel premedication.  Chronic daily treatment with corticosteroids with a dose of greater than or equal to 10 mg/day methylprednisolone equivalent (excluding inhaled steroids).  Uncontrolled hypertension defined as a systolic BP greater than 150 mmHg or diastolic BP greater than 90 mmHg, with or without anti-hypertensive medications. (Patients with hypertension that is well-controlled on medication are eligible.)  Cardiac disease (history of and/or active disease) that would preclude the use of any of the drugs included in the treatment regimen. This includes but is not confined to: Active cardiac disease: symptomatic angina pectoris within the past 180 days that required the initiation of or increase in anti-anginal medication or other intervention; ventricular arrhythmias except for benign premature ventricular contractions; supraventricular and nodal arrhythmias requiring a pacemaker or not controlled with medication; conduction abnormality requiring a pacemaker; valvular disease with documented compromise in cardiac function; and symptomatic pericarditis. History of cardiac disease: myocardial infarction documented by elevated cardiac enzymes or persistent regional wall abnormalities on assessment of LV function; history of documented congestive heart failure (CHF); and documented cardiomyopathy.  Other nonmalignant systemic disease that would preclude the patient from receiving study treatment or would prevent required follow-up.  Pregnancy or lactation at the time of randomization.  The investigator should assess the patient to determine if she has any psychiatric or addictive disorder or other condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude her from meeting the study requirements.  Use of any investigational agent within 4 weeks prior to randomization.

Renal function is not relevant for inclusion.	Contradiction	"Inclusion Criteria:  The following criteria are to be checked at the time of study entry. The patients may only be included in the study if ALL of the following statements are FULLFILLED:  The patient (male or female) is at least 18 years old at the time of signature of the informed consent form.  Written informed consent has been obtained from the patient prior to the performance of any protocol-specific procedure.  The patient is diagnosed with confirmed invasive breast cancer with stage IV disease.  Note: If the metastatic disease is restricted to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic nature should be confirmed by cytology or histology.  The patient has documented disease progression or relapse following at least one prior standard therapy with trastuzumab (alone or in combination with chemotherapy).  Patients with prior lapatinib use are eligible. Furthermore,  The administration of the chemotherapeutic agent(s) should have been stopped for at least 28 days by the time of the first ASCI administration.  The administration of trastuzumab alone could be maintained after chemotherapy, but the last dose of trastuzumab should not have been given less than three weeks before the first ASCI administration.  The patient will not be given trastuzumab during the trial.  For metastatic patients whose disease is ER+ and/or PR+ the following criteria should be met:  Patients with visceral disease that requires chemotherapy (eg., patients with liver or lung metastases).  Rapidly progressing or life threatening disease, as determined by the investigator.  Patients who received hormonal therapy and are no longer benefiting from this therapy.  A tumor lesion from the patient biopsied before or during screening shows either:  Overexpression of the HER2 protein, as determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC, with result IHC 3+) or  Amplification of the HER2 gene as determined by FISH (at least 4 fold i.e. at least 8 copies).  Note: Overexpression/amplification measurements must be performed on a metastatic lesion in all cases where such a lesion is sufficiently easily accessible. If however such a biopsy is not possible, then these measurements can be performed on the primary tumor. Use of the primary tumor is to be documented and justified.  Ten FFPE tissue sections of the tumor on which the HER2 overexpression/amplification has been done -if available-may be requested. These may be used to retrospectively carry out part of the translational research (i.e. analysis of EGF receptor activity and of the presence of immune effector cells, refer to Section 7).  The patient has at least one measurable lesion according to RECIST criteria.  The patient has ECOG status of 0 or 1.  The patient has adequate bone marrow reserve as indicated by:  White blood cell count >/= 3,000/mm3.  Neutrophil count >/= 1,500/mm3.  Platelet count >/= 100,000/mm3.  Hemoglobin levels >/= 10.0 g/dl.  The patient has adequate renal function as shown by the creatinine levels (i.e. within the normal range).  The patient has adequate hepatic function as shown by serum bilirubin levels i.e:  Serum bilirubin levels within the normal limits.  Both AST and ALT levels <1.5 times the ULN. Note: However, for patients with liver metastasis, a serum bilirubin level <1.5 times the ULN and both AST and ALT levels <3 times the ULN will be accepted.  The patient has a baseline Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) measured by MUGA scan equal to or greater than the LLN for the radiology facility.  If the patient is female, she must be of non-childbearing potential, i.e. have a current tubal ligation, hysterectomy, ovariectomy or be post-menopausal, or if she is of childbearing potential, she must practice adequate contraception for 30 days prior to treatment, have a negative pregnancy test and continue such precautions for two months after completion of the study treatment.  Adequate contraception is defined as a contraceptive method with failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly (when applicable, as mentioned in the product label) for example abstinence, combined or progestogen oral contraceptives, injectable progestogen, implants of levonorgestrel, oestrogenic vaginal ring, percutaneous contraceptive patches or intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS), vasectomy with documented azoospermia of the sole male partner or double barrier method (condom or occlusive cap plus spermicidal agent).  For azoospermia, ""documented"" refers to the outcome of the investigator's/ designee's medical examination of the subject or review of the subject's medical history for study eligibility, as obtained via a verbal interview with the subject or from the subject's medical records.  Post-menopause: Menopause is the age associated with complete cessation of menstrual cycles, menses, and implies the loss of reproductive potential by ovarian failure. A practical definition accepts menopause after 1 year without menses with an appropriate clinical profile at the appropriate age e.g. > 45 years.  Able to swallow and retain oral medication.  In the view of the investigator, the patient can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol.Exclusion Criteria:  The following criteria should be checked at the time of study entry. If any apply, the patient must not be included in the study:  The patient has received > 300 mg/m2 doxorubicin (cumulative dose) or > 600 mg/m2 epirubicin (cumulative dose).  The patient is receiving treatment with bisphosphonate UNLESS the biphosphonate treatment was initiated more than three weeks before the first ASCI administration. (See also section 5.3.2.).  The patient has received any investigational or non-registered product (drug or vaccine) other than the study treatment(s) within 30 days preceding the first dose of study treatment, or planned use during the study period.  The patient is currently receiving amiodarone or has received amiodarone in the 6 months prior to screening.  The patient requires concomitant treatment with systemic corticosteroids or any immunosuppressive agents. The use of prednisone, or equivalent, <0.5 mg/kg/day (absolute maximum 40 mg/day), or inhaled corticosteroids or topical steroids is permitted.  The patient has a malabsorption syndrome, disease significantly affecting gastrointestinal function, or resection of the stomach or small bowel.  Patients with ulcerative colitis.  The patient has known coronary artery disease, arrhythmia requiring treatment, clinically significant valvular disease, cardiomegaly on chest X-ray, ventricular hypertrophy (found by ECG) or previous myocardial infarction.  The patient has any acute or chronic, clinically significant pulmonary, cardiovascular, hepatic or renal functional abnormality, as determined by physical examination or laboratory screening tests.  The patient has current active hepatic or biliary's disease (with exception of patients with Gilbert's syndrome, asymptomatic gallstones, liver metastases or stable chronic liver disease per investigator assessment).  The patient presents with autoimmune disease (vitiligo and autoimmune thyroid disease is not an exclusion criterion).  The patient has a known family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency.  The patient has any uncontrolled bleeding disorder or coagulation disorder or thrombocytopenia or pro-thrombotic disorder.  The patient has a history of anaphylaxis or severe allergic reaction to vaccines or unknown allergens.  The patient has a known immediate or delayed hypersensitivity reaction or idiosyncrasy to drugs chemically related to Lapatinib. These include other anilinoquinazolines, such as gefitinib (Iressa), erlotinib (Tarceva), or other chemically related compounds or excipients.  The patient is known to be positive for the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).  The patient has (or has had) previous or concomitant malignancies at other sites except effectively treated:  Non-melanoma skin cancers or carcinoma in situ of the cervix  Malignancy that has been in remission for > 2 years and is considered highly likely to have been cured.  The patient has any psychiatric or addictive disorder that may compromise her ability to give informed consent, or to comply with the trial procedures.  The patient has any other condition that in the opinion of the investigator might jeopardize the patient's safety or ability to comply with the requirements of the study.  The patient is pregnant or lactating."

Every effort should be made to make paraffin embedded tissue or slides from the diagnostic biopsy or surgical specimen available for confirmation of diagnosis.  Patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease who have received at least two (and not more than five) prior chemotherapeutic regimens for breast cancer, at least one of which was administered for treatment of locally advanced or metastatic disease.  Prior therapy must be documented by the following criteria prior to entry onto study:  Regimens must have included an anthracycline (eg, doxorubicin, epirubicin), a taxane (eg, paclitaxel, docetaxel) and capecitabine in any combination or order.  One or two of these regimens may have been administered as adjuvant and/or neoadjuvant therapy.  Patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2/neu) over-expressing tumors must additionally have been treated with trastuzumab.  Patients with estrogen receptor-expressing tumors may have additionally been treated with estrogen-specific therapy.  Prior hormonal therapy, biological therapy, (eg, trastuzumab, bevacizumab), or immunotherapy, is not to be counted as one of the 2 to 5 prior chemotherapy regimens allowed. However, hormonal therapy must be discontinued one week before administration of E7389, and biological therapy must be discontinued two weeks before E7389 administration.  Patients who are being treated with bisphosphonates when they enter the study are allowed to continue the medication as long as the dosing does not change. In case a change in dosing is deemed necessary, the case needs to be discussed with the Sponsor.  Progression on or within six months of the last regimen for advanced disease, documented by the following:  The dates of treatment, doses, outcome of therapy and the reason for discontinuation of prior anthracycline, taxane, capecitabine, and trastuzumab therapy must be provided.  Prior to entry onto the study, information ensuring that the last therapy fulfills eligibility criteria is required, which includes progression while receiving this last prior chemotherapy regimen, or within six months of receiving that therapy.  Chemotherapy medication administration sheets or other official medical/hospital records indicating type and dates of chemotherapy must be available for inspection, and one of the following as a reason for discontinuation of medication is required: radiographic evidence of progression, or doctor's office or hospitalization notes documenting radiologic progression, clinically documented increase in tumor burden, and/or increase in tumor-specific markers.  Patients with measurable disease by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one diameter (at least 10 mm in longest diameter [LD] by spiral computer tomography [CT] scan), or at least 20 mm by standard techniques. If the only measurable lesion is a lymph node, it must measure at least 20 mm in LD. If a single lesion is identified as the target lesion, a biopsy or aspiration with cytological or histological confirmation of the diagnosis of breast carcinoma is required.  Resolution of all chemotherapy or radiation-related toxicities to less than Grade 2 severity, except for stable sensory neuropathy  Grade 2 and alopecia.  Age >= 18 years.  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 to 2.  Life expectancy of  3 months.  Adequate renal function as evidenced by serum creatinine  2.0 mg/dL or calculated creatinine clearance  40 mL/minute (min) per the Cockcroft and Gault formula.  Adequate bone marrow function as evidenced by absolute neutrophil count (ANC) 1.5 x 10^9/L hemoglobin  10.0 g/dL (acceptable if it is corrected by therapeutic intervention or transfusional support), and platelet count  100 x 10^9/L.  Adequate liver function as evidenced by bilirubin  1.5 mg/dL and alkaline phosphatase, alanine transaminase (ALT), and aspartate transaminase (AST)  3 times the upper limits of normal (ULN) (in the case of liver metastases  5 x ULN), unless there are bone metastases, in which case liver specific alkaline phosphatase must be separated from the total and used to assess the liver function instead of the total alkaline phosphatase.  Willing and able to complete the European Organization for Research on the Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) quality of life assessment, Analgesic Diary, and Pain Visual Analog Scale (VAS).  Willing and able to comply with the study protocol for the duration of the study.  Written informed consent prior to any study-specific screening procedures with the understanding that the patient may withdraw consent at any time without prejudice.Exclusion Criteria:  Patients must not have received chemotherapy, radiation, or biologic therapy within two weeks, hormonal therapy within one week, or trastuzumab within three weeks, before E7389 treatment start.  Patients must not have received radiation therapy encompassing > 30% of marrow (a lesion that has been irradiated cannot be used as a target lesion, unless it has progressed after the irradiation).  Patients must not have pre-existing neuropathy > Grade 2.  Patients must not have participated in a prior E7389 clinical trial.

Contradiction	Outcome Measurement:   Progression-Free Survival (PFS) Rate  PFS was based on Kaplan-Meier estimates. PFS was defined as time in weeks from start of study treatment to first documentation of objective tumor progression or death due to any cause. PFS was calculated as (first event date minus the date of first dose of study medication plus 1) divided by 7. Tumor progression was determined from oncologic assessment data (where data meet the criteria for progressive disease [PD]), or from death case report forms (CRFs).

Entailment	Outcome Measurement:   Objective Response Rate (ORR)  The ORR was defined as the percentage of participants with best overall response (BOR) of confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. Targeted lesions were assessed by computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) which were then assessed by the investigator based on RECIST. CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions. PR was defined as at least 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference baseline sum diameters. Possible CR and PR had to be confirmed no fewer than 4 weeks after the initial response assessment. A brain and bone scan was performed by CT/MRI within 1 week after confirmation of a response to ensure no new metastases. To be assigned a status of CR or PR, changes in tumor measurements had to be confirmed by repeat evaluations, to be performed not fewer than 4 weeks after the response criteria were first met.

However, a median PFS of 13 months or greater (regardless of whether the 95% confidence interval for the median extends below 8 months) could also indicate promising results.
